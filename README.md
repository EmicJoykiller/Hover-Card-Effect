The Hovering Card Effect project is a visually engaging and interactive web component designed to enhance user experience on web pages. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a card element that responds to user interaction with a smooth, animated hover effect. The main card features an image and a brief description, which, when hovered over, triggers a transition that moves and rotates both the front and back cards. This effect not only adds a dynamic visual appeal but also highlights the content in an eye-catching manner. The project demonstrates advanced CSS techniques, such as transitions, transformations, and layering with z-index, to achieve a polished and professional look. This kind of interactive element can be effectively used in portfolios, landing pages, or any web page that aims to capture and retain user attention through engaging UI elements.
